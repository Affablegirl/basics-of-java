A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time. The program then writes out the recommended heating time.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Microwave
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the number of items");
        int i=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the single item heating time");
        float s=sc.nextFloat();
        if(i==2){
            System.out.printf("The recommended heating time is %.2f",s/2+s);
        }
        else if(i==3){
            System.out.printf("The recommended heating time is %.2f",s*2);
        }
        else{
             System.out.printf("Number of items is more");
        }
        
        //Write your code
    }
}
