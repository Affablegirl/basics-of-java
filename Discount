Mrs.Raja is a miser to the core.She saves money even on petite things. One dayshe heard a discount offer announced in a shop. she wants to purchase lot of items to save her money. The discount is given only when atleast two items are bought. Since each item has different discount prices , she finds difficult to check the amount she has saved. So she approaches you to device a automated discount calculator to make her easy while billing. 
import java.util.*;
public class Discount
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        float a=sc.nextFloat();
        float b=sc.nextFloat();
        float d=sc.nextFloat();
        float c=(a+b)*d/100;
        System.out.printf("%.2f\n",a+b);
        System.out.printf("%.2f\n",a+b-c);
        System.out.printf("%.2f",c);
        //write your code
    }
}
