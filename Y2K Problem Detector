Write a program that asks a user for their birth year encoded as two digits (like "62") and for the current year, also encoded as two digits (like "99"). The program is to correctly write out the userâ€™s age in years.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Agedetect
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter Year of Birth ");
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter Current year ");
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        if(b<a){
            System.out.printf("Your age is %d",(100-a)+b);
        }
        else{
            System.out.printf("Your age is %d",b-a);
        }
    }
}
