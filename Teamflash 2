Diffny also joined the group of Team Flash. Meanwhile, Diffny also moved to a new house in the same locality nearby to the other three. Now the houses of Joe, Ramsey and vixon are located in the shape of a triangle. Harry also has moved to a house in the same locality. When the Team Flash asked daffy about the location of his house , he said that his house is equidistant from the houses of the other 3. Can you please help them find out the location of the house?Given the 3 locations {(x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3)} of a triangle, write a program to determine the point which is equidistant from all the 3 points.

public class Flash
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
      Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
      int x1=sc.nextInt();
      int y1=sc.nextInt();
      int x2=sc.nextInt();
      int y2=sc.nextInt();
      int x3=sc.nextInt();
      int y3=sc.nextInt();
      float a=(float)(x1+x2+x3)/3;
      float b=(float)(y1+y2+y3)/3;
      System.out.printf("%.1f\n%.1f",a,b);
        //write your code
    }
}
