For instance, if there are 50 students in the class and if the class has to be divided into 7 equal sized teams, 7 students will be there in each team and 1 student will be left out. PET sir asks your help to automate this team splitting task. Can you please help him out?

    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int s=sc.nextInt();
        int t=sc.nextInt();
        int a=s/t;
        int b=s%t;
        System.out.printf("The number of students in each team is %d and left out is %d",a,b);
