In this problem you must write a program that determines if two circles intersect each other. The input to your program will be the <x, y> coordinates for the center of each circle, followed by the radius(r) of each circle. The output will state whether the circles overlap, do not overlap, or are tangential (i.e., tangential circles touch each other at just one common point).
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.io.*;
public class Circle
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int x1=sc.nextInt();
        int y1=sc.nextInt();
        int r1=sc.nextInt();
        int x2=sc.nextInt();
        int y2=sc.nextInt();
        int r2=sc.nextInt();
        double d=Math.sqrt((x1-x2) * (x1-x2) + (y1-y2) * (y1-y2));
        if(d<r1+r2){
            System.out.println("The circles overlap");
        }
        else if(d==r1+r2){
             System.out.println("The circles are tangential");
        }
        else{
             System.out.println("The circles do not overlap");
        }
        //Write your code
    }
}
